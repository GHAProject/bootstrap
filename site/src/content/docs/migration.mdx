## v6.0.0

### Helpers

- Ratio helpers have been moved to utilities.
- Dropped clearfix helper for `.d-flow-root` utility.

### Utilities

- Ratio helpers are now powered by the utility API and use simplified values without `calc()`.
- mdo-do: Need to refactor utilities API if we want to restor the commented out custom ratios.
- **Display utilities:** added `flow-root` option for a modern clearfix.
- **Sizing utilities:**
  - Renamed `.mh-*`/`.mw-*` to `.max-h-*`/`.max-w-*`
  - Added `.min-h-*` and `.min-w-*` utilities with two default values, `0` and `100%`
  - Added `auto`, `min-content`, `max-content`, and `fit-content` to `width` and `height` utilities.

### Sass

- Dropped support for Node Sass, including no longer testing any of our source CSS against it.
- Removed `add()` and `subtract()` functions. Use `calc()` instead.

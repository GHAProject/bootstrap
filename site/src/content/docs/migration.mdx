## v6.0.0

### Helpers

- Ratio helpers have been moved to utilities.

### Utilities

- Ratio helpers are now powered by the utility API and use simplified `calc()`s in their values.

### Sass

- Dropped support for Node Sass, including no longer testing any of our source CSS against it.
- Removed `add()` and `subtract()` functions. Use `calc()` instead.
